# Automation Scripts Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my **Automation Scripts Repository**! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts aimed at automating various tasks. These tasks include web scraping, data processing, image downloading for computer vision datasets, and other automation processes that make development more efficient.

The goal of this repository is to provide simple and effective tools for automating routine tasks, so you can spend more time focusing on innovation and less on repetitive work.

## Current Features

- **Image Downloader for Computer Vision**: A script that uses Python to automatically search for and download images from the web based on a keyword. This is ideal for building datasets for machine learning and computer vision projects.
  
- **Web Scraping**: Tools to scrape information from various websites using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`. These scripts can extract useful data in a structured way, which can then be used for further analysis.

- **Data Processing**: Automation for handling large datasets, cleaning, and formatting them to meet your project needs. This includes handling CSV, JSON, and other file formats.

## Future Plans

This repository will expand to include:
- **Automated Reporting**: Scripts that generate automated reports from data, helping to streamline the analysis process.
- **API Interaction**: Automation scripts to interact with different APIs, collecting and managing data in real-time.
- **Task Scheduling**: Adding functionality to schedule and run automation tasks at set intervals, improving workflow efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the scripts in this repository, ensure you have Python installed and the following packages:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Running the Scripts
Each script is designed to be run independently. You can clone this repository and execute any script like so:

```bash
python <script_name.py>
```

Each script has inline comments to explain the functionality and parameters. For example, the image downloader requires a keyword to search for images and a limit on how many images to download.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by adding your own automation scripts! Whether you're automating file handling, data collection, or any other repetitive tasks, this repository welcomes useful additions. 

To contribute, simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Let's build a powerful collection of automation tools together!
